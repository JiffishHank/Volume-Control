# Volume Control

## Description
#### Allows a user to control a computer's volume from his or her phone.  This works by running a simple server on your computer and a client on your phone which communicates via UDP connection.
######Note: The server will only work on a Windows computer and the client will only work on an Android device.

## About
#### As I was laying in bed listening to music from my computer across the room, I wanted to lower the volume a little bit but was not in the mood to actually get up and out of bed to do so.  Having just discovered Android development, I decided to try and make a simple app that will both allow me to be lazier as well as learning Android development at the same time.

###### Note: This is a work in progress and still needs more testing.
